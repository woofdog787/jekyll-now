    <td>5 weeks ago we started our python buzzfeed quiz. It started off by us going onto buzzfeed and doing a random quiz. Mr keen has helped us with the code and now we are meant to do 10 questions on anything. Now I have progressed after trying to fix my work to adding a calculator part at the end to tell the quizzer what age category they it in.(I have done this by designing obvious questions in order to figure it out according to what my family likes) But it is not 100 percent accurate</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Today not much limites my learning as I spent most of the lesson figuring out how to make a calculator at the end of my code that figures the sum of all the questions. I found this quite complex as I did not know how to specifically answer this question and It required a specific answer. That is what limited my learning.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Although this is getting better, next time I would listen and write down what all that I was meant to be doing in order to best improve my long term memory of the lesson and to focus more on how the code works especially the work we did this week on the calculater.(Long term improvement) In addition I will try to recall more information on the topic and not let my neighbor distract me even though on this case he helped me and we worked together to figure out this specific problem.</td>
