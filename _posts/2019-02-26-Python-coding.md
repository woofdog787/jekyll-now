    <td>3 weeks ago we started our python buzzfeed quiz. It started off by us going onto buzzfeed and doing a random quiz. Mr keen has helped us with the code and now we are meant to do 10 questions on anything. I am doing how old you are in categories of 20 years. At the moment I am struggling a bit with my code but in next lesson I will hopefully fix it with a bit of help from Arjan.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I need  to work on not relying on friends as much and to try and be a more independent learner. In addition I need to ask more questions about the code and ask for more advice in lessons. I will try and not copy code straight off the board and try and make it my own instead of stealing it. This should help me further understand the code.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I would listen and write down what all that I was meant to be doing in order to best improve my long term memory of the lesson and to focus more on how the code works. I will also try to keep a bit more focused and try to answer more questions( or have a go at some). In addition I will try to recall more information on the topic and not let my neighbor distract me.</td>
