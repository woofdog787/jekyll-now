    <td>4 weeks ago we started our python buzzfeed quiz. It started off by us going onto buzzfeed and doing a random quiz. Mr keen has helped us with the code and now we are meant to do 10 questions on anything. I am doing how old you are in categories of 20 years.Today I me and millind worked to fix the problem and at the start Mr Keen talks us through how to loop our code instead of having tonnes of lines when it could be 40 or 50. I found this quite complex and tried it on a new project file.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>The work I did half worked but again i need to work on my independant skill sand to not just copy off the board. I need  to work on not relying on friends as much and to try and be a independent learner although I think I have been improving on this one. In addition I need to ask more questions about the code and ask for more advice in lessons. I will try and not copy code straight off the board and try and make it my own instead of stealing it. This should help me further understand the code.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Although this is getting better, next time I would listen and write down what all that I was meant to be doing in order to best improve my long term memory of the lesson and to focus more on how the code works especially the work we did this week on loops. I will also try to keep a bit more focused and try to answer more questions( or have a go at some). In addition I will try to recall more information on the topic and not let my neighbor distract me even though on this case he helped me.</td>
