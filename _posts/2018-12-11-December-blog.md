    <td>In It so far we have learned how to change the colour of things in html, how to change fonts and to make different adjustments I to the webpage. Looking at W3 schools allowed me to be able to complete the majority of work around changing font colour. I our lesson we also go told about computers internally and how they work which was very interesting.Now we have progressed to python and working on our buzzfeed quizzes</td>

    <td>Not much limited my learning this lesson as I managed to create the work to a high standard without much input from the teacher and I completed it in a short amount of time.This happens most lessons but as I am a bit behind on work I am not entirely sure what happened two weeks ago . In addition last lesson we stayed at the front to answer and question what Mr.Keen is saying </td>

    <td>Next time I would listen and write down what all that I was meant to be doing in order to best improve my long term memory of the lesson so I could duplicate this in the future if I wanted to create a blog. I will also try to keep a bit more focused and try to answer more questions. In addition I will try to recall more information on the topic and not let my neighbor distract me.This blog is mostly about the basics but next time I will go into more details about the discussion
